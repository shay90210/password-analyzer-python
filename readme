# Python Password Analyzer

## Project Description 
I completed my project using the fundamentals of Python. This is my first project coded in Python to show the beginning skills that I acquired from my Python Fundamentals course with Nucamp. The Python Password Analyzer begins with the requesting a user to register their name. Once their name is registered, the Analyzer requests that the user creates a password. The user will go through a loop before creating a successful password. The loop does force the user to create a passwor that not only includes lower and upper-cased alphabet, but also numbers and special characters. 

I chose this project because I have a heavy interest in the cybersecurity side software engineering, and I wanted this project to emulate a secure way for users to create passwords that can not be infiltrated or obtained from cyber attacks.
